  # This version includes concurrency fixes, but excludes changes to the
  # library APIs. Using a version beyond this would require users to build the
  # Thrift compiler from source to get API-compatible generated code. After the
  # next Thrift release, this should become that tagged release (and the code
  # generated appropriately).
